## Deep Learning for Speech and Language
{: .text-purple}

### 2nd Winter School at Universitat Polit&egrave;cnica de Catalunya (2018)

Language and speech technologies are rapidly evolving thanks to the current advances in artificial intelligence. The convergence of large-scale datasets and affordable GPU hardware has allowed the training of neural networks for data analysis tasks which were previously addressed with hand-crafted features. Applications such as machine translation or speech recognition can be tackled from a neural perspective with novel architectures that combine convolutional and/or recurrent models with attention. This winter school overview the state of the art on deep learning for speech and language ad introduces the programming skills and techniques required to train these systems.
