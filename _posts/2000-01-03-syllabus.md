* 19/09: First steps with [Keras](https://keras.io/)
* 26/09: First steps with [PyTorch](http://pytorch.org/)
* 03/10: First steps with [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/)
* 10/10: First steps with [Caffe2](https://caffe2.ai/)
* 17/10: Scalability basics
* 24/10: Scalability basics
* 31/10: Case study
* 21/11: Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)

## Project

Students will work in teams to develop a machine learning research project that will be presented as a poster during the final session open to the general public. Students can get inspiration from the following resources:

* Open source projects from UPC: [Visual Question Answering](http://imatge-upc.github.io/vqa-2016-cvprw/), [Image Captioning](https://github.com/amaiasalvador/imcap_keras)
* [NIPS 2017 Competition Track](https://nips.cc/Conferences/2017/CompetitionTrack)
* [Stanford cs213n student projects](http://cs231n.stanford.edu/reports.html)
* [Competitions on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions)
